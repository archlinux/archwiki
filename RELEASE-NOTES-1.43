== MediaWiki 1.43.0-PRERELEASE ==

== Upgrading notes for 1.43 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.35.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.43 upgrades are below:

* It is now necessary that the OpenSSL PHP extension is installed.
* update.php updates the Linter database table with two migration scripts that
  can take a long time to run: with the provided settings, each migration
  script update roughly 500 rows per second. If at all possible, it is
  highly recommended to let update.php run these migration scripts.

  If this is deemed too long a maintenance operation (depending on the number
  of rows in the Linter database table), it is possible, for a upgrade from
  1.40 onwards, to run the migration scripts before updating the MediaWiki
  and extensions files to 1.43. Set $wgLinterWriteNamespaceColumnStage and
  $wgLinterWriteTagAndTemplateColumnsStage to true, and run the
  extensions/Linter/maintenance/migrateNamespace.php and
  extensions/Linter/maintenance/migrateTagTemplate.php migration scripts
  before proceeding with any other code update.
  When upgrading from a version <= 1.39, a multi-step update is necessary to
  be able to run the migration scripts independently from update.php: first
  update to 1.42, then proceed as indicated.

For notes on 1.42.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.43 ===

* $wgBlockTargetMigrationStage, which was introduced in 1.42, is now deprecated
  and has no effect.

==== New configuration ====

* (T13555) $wgParserEnableLegacyHeadingDOM - Defaults to `true`, can be set to
  `false` to enable new, more accessible HTML markup for wikitext headings.
  Note that each skin must also use the 'supportsMwHeading' option to allow it.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  In a future release the new markup will become the default,
  and later this option will be removed.
* (T12347) $wgEnableProtectionIndicators - Defaults to false, setting it to true
  shows a lock icon indicator on protected pages.
* (T373480) $wgSortedCategories - Defaults to false, setting it to true will
  sort the categories shown on article pages.  This is an experimental setting;
  its future will depend on community adoption and feedback on the phab task
  is welcome.
* (T45646) $wgAllowRawHtmlCopyrightMessages - Defaults to true, can be set to
  false to disable the use of the localisation messages 'copyright' and
  'history_copyright' and the hook 'SkinCopyrightFooter', which have been
  deprecated in this release. This helps protect your wiki against attacks by
  a rogue administrator account and will become the default in the future.
* (T4085) $wgParserEnableUserLanguage - Defaults to false, can be set to
  true to let {{USERLANGUAGE}} magic word return the user's language,
  instead of the page language. Beware that accessing the user language may
  reduce the efficiency of the parser cache.

==== Changed configuration ====

* wgPageLinksSchemaMigrationStage – (T299947) This temporary setting, which
  controls the database schema migration for the page links table, is now set
  by default to write to both old and new data and read from the new data.
* wgFooterIcons – (T256190) The default "Powered by MediaWiki" button icon has
  been updated to an SVG icon, and the footer icons are now wrapped as buttons
  in HTML, rather than faking it within the icons themselves. You should adjust
  any footer icons you provide or over-ride to match.
* The "error-json" channel, configurable via $wgDebugLogGroups, has been
  removed. For structured logging, use the "error" channel directly instead.
  Since MediaWiki 1.25, structured logging is supported via Monolog for all
  channels, including the "error" channel. For silenced errors, you use the
  "silenced-error" channel added in MediaWiki 1.42. (T193472)
* wgResourceLoaderUseObjectCacheForDeps - (T343492) This is now enabled by
  default. This means ResourceLoader writes information to the MainStash
  instead of a core database table, which can be set to a separate database
  via wgMainStash. If you find issues, please drop a comment on T343492.
  It is now deprecated and will be removed in MediaWiki 1.44.

==== Removed configuration ====

* wgSessionInsecureSecrets has been removed since OpenSSL is now a required
  PHP extension.
* $wgTemplateLinksSchemaMigrationStage has been removed.
* $wgSamplingStatsdClient has been removed. It was introduced in MW 1.28 for
  use in the Wikibase extension, but never used. The new StatsFactory service
  should be used for new instrumentations, which already supports sampling.
  Beware that sampling is generally not needed even at scale, and that sampling
  does not significantly reduce runtime overhead, thus making it slow to
  instrument very hot code even with built-in sampling.
* (T294397) The 'writeapi' userright, which controlled access to some API
  modules, has been removed.
* (T331883) The variables $wgLinterWriteTagAndTemplateColumnsStage,
  $wgLinterUserInterfaceTagAndTemplateStage, $wgLinterWriteNamespaceColumnStage,
  and $wgLinterUseNamespaceColumnStage have been removed. The namespace,
  tag and template column of the Linter database table are now written and used.
  The existing data from the Linter database is migrated to the new columns
  by extensions/Linter/maintenance/migrateNamespace.php and
  extensions/Linter/maintenance/migrateTagTemplate.php, which are both called
  by the update script (T367207).

=== New user-facing features in 1.43 ===

* (T338341) Support reading XMP and EXIF from WebP files
* (T365636) Wiki's with wgAllowExternalImages enabled now detect urls
  with AVIF, SVG and WebP images.
* (T242346) Special:TalkPage is a new special page that will redirect to the
  associated talk namespace page, e.g. [[Special:TalkPage/Foo]] redirects to
  [[Talk:Foo]]; [[Special:TalkPage/Project:Foo]] goes to [[Project talk:Foo]].
  This allows for links by templates and tools without having to parse what
  namespaces are valid and have associated talk pages.
* New preference: "Send password reset emails only when both email address
  and username are provided."
* (T4085) Added new magic word {{USERLANGUAGE}} which returns the language code
  of the interface set by the user.
* (T263513) Special:NamespaceInfo is a new special page that displays a list
  of namespaces available on the wiki, their descriptions and configuration.

=== New developer features in 1.43 ===

* StatusValue class gained new method getMessages(): MessageSpecifier[],
  allowing the errors to be inspected and displayed more easily, for example:
    foreach ( $status->getMessages() as $msg ) {
      if ( $msg->getKey() !== 'ignored-message' ) {
        $this->getOutput()->addWikiMsg( $msg );
      }
    }
* (T358779) The MessageValue class can now be used instead of Message in most
  places (in methods that accept the MessageSpecifier interface). This allows
  using localisation messages in code that doesn't know the user's language,
  such as many hooks, without relying on global state. To convert between them,
  use MessageValue::newFromSpecifier() and Message::newFromSpecifier().
* The REST API framework now supports defining redirects in route definition
  files. See MediaWiki\Rest\Handler\RedirectHandler for details.
* (T13555) Skins can enable the 'supportsMwHeading' option for new, more
  accessible HTML markup for wikitext headings. MediaWiki's own styles and
  scripts have been updated to support it, but your skin may also need updates.
  More information: https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Heading_HTML_changes
  A future release will emit deprecation warnings for skins with
  'supportsMwHeading' set to false.
* The AuthPreserveQueryParams hook was added.
* (T219397) New `Language::formatDurationBetweenTimestamps()` function added
  which takes two timestamps and a precision in order to calculate a more
  accurate text representation of duration.
* Added an interactive mode to the install.php maintenance script.
* The ResourceLoaderModifyEmbeddedSourceUrls hook was added.
* The AuthManagerFilterProviders hook was added.
* The AuthManagerVerifyAuthentication hook was added.
* The OutputPageRenderCategoryLink hook was added, as a replacement for the
  deprecated OutputPageMakeCategoryLinks hook.
* PreAuthenticationProvider, PrimaryAuthenticationProvider, and
  SecondaryAuthenticationProvider now receive a `canAlwaysAutocreate` flag in
  the options of the `testUserForCreation` invocation. This flag is true when
  the session provider is exempt from autocreate user permissions checks.
* The CentralIdLookup service gained the isOwned() method, which can be used
  to check if a local username is reserved for a central user, even if a local
  user account does not exist yet. This can be used by extensions to look
  up information about the central user.
* (T251790) A Jest-based test suite has been introduced for testing front-end
  code such as Vue components. Tests can be run via `npm run jest`, and test
  files live in `tests/jest/`. See https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Jest
  for more information.
* The SpreadAnyEditBlock hook was added.
* The ConditionalDefaultOptionsAddCondition hook was added.

=== External library changes in 1.43 ===

* The OOjs Router library has been merged into core and will be archived
  upstream.

===== New development-only external libraries =====

  no longer attempts to ignore database errors. (T278543)

=== Action API changes in 1.43 ===

  created before December 2005 (their registration date was not recorded).

=== Languages updated in 1.43 ===
MediaWiki supports over 350 languages. Many localisations are updated regularly.
Below only new and removed languages are listed, as well as changes to languages
because of Phabricator reports.

* (T375891) Updated the autonym for Kadazan Dusun (dtp)
* (T357853) Added unidirectional script conversion for Meitei to Bengali script.
* (T367377) Updated the autonym for Tai Nuea (tdd)

  This is done experimentally, with only a Names.php entry and
  namespace translations, before we have actual localized strings.
  For details, see https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Future_of_Language_Incubation.
* (T356144) Deprecated the Kanuri language (kr) and replaced it
  with Central Kanuri (knc). The language code kr is kept for
  backwards compatibility and falls back to knc.

=== Breaking changes in 1.43 ===

* (T358779) The format of parameters used by the Message class has changed.
  Instead of arrays in a special format, they are now MessageParam objects.
  Code that simply called methods like Message::numParam() and didn't look
  inside the values they return should be unaffected. Code that depended on
  the formatted params being arrays or accessed their keys will need updates.
  Example patches: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/q/topic:message-param
* ErrorPageError public properties 'msg' and 'title' may now contain
  any MessageSpecifier object, not just Message.
* Reset button functionality suppressReset() and $mShowReset from HTMLForm
  was removed without replacement.

  UserGroupMembership::getGroupMemberName(), deprecated in 1.40, have
  been removed.

  as it's not used anywhere.
* CommentFormatter::formatStringsAsBlock() has been removed without deprecation
  as it's not used anywhere.
* ILoadBalancer::laggedReplicaUsed() has been moved to ILoadBalancerForOwner::
  effectively making it internal.
* Define DB_MASTER, deprecated since 1.36, has been removed.
* ILoadBalancer::DB_MASTER, deprecated since 1.36, has been removed.
* Overriding MWException::getHTML(), ::getText(), ::getPageTitle(), and
  ::reportHTML() in order to display custom exception messages is no
  longer supported.
* In PageHandlerTestTrait, the newRouter() method was renamed to
  newRouterForPageHandler() to avoid a conflict with a method of the same
  name in RestTestTrait. Also, PageHandlerTestTrait is no longer marked as
  "stable to use". It was marked this way by accident, the functionality it
  provides is specific to certain handlers implemented in MediaWiki core.
* MediaWikiIntegrationTestCase::addCoreDBData(), deprecated since 1.41, has
  been removed.
* wfUnpack(), deprecated since 1.42, has been removed in favor of
  StringUtils::unpack().

* Constructing MWHttpRequest objects now requires timeout and connectTimeout to
  be set; this was deprecated in 1.35.
* Hooks that were run from SpecialContributions are now run from the parent,
  ContributionsSpecialPage. The page passed in is a ContributionsSpecialPage
  type, and documentation and type comparisons may need to be updated. Affected
  hooks are: ContributionsBeforeMainOutputHook, ContributionsToolLinksHook,
  SpecialContributions__getForm__filtersHook.
* Hooks that were run from ContribsPager are now run from the parent,
  ContributionsPager. If a pager is passed in, it is a ContributionsPager type,
  and documentation and type comparisons may need to be updated. Affected
  hooks are: ContribsPager__reallyDoQueryHook, ContribsPager__getQueryInfoHook,
  ContributionsLineEndingHook, SpecialContributions__formatRow__flagsHook.
* Hooks that were run from DeletedContribsPager are now run from the parent,
  ContributionsPager. If a pager is passed in, it is a ContributionsPager type,
  and documentation and type comparisons may need to be updated. Affected
  hooks are: DeletedContribsPager__reallyDoQueryHook and
  DeletedContributionsLineEndingHook.
* The public method ContributionsSpecialPage::getUserLinks has been made
  protected. Although not marked @internal, the method was public to be called

* The $domain parameter to ILoadBalancer::getReadOnlyReason(), deprecated in
  1.40, has been removed.
* WikiPage::doDeleteArticleBatched, hard deprecated since 1.37, has been
  removed.
* SpecialEmailUser::submit, deprecated since 1.41, has been removed.
* SpecialEmailUser::validateTarget, deprecated since 1.41, has been removed.
* SpecialEmailUser::getPermissionsError, deprecated since 1.41 has been
  removed.
* SpecialBlock::getTargetAndType, deprecated since 1.36, has been removed.
* ApiQueryBlockInfoTrait::addBlockInfoToQuery(), deprecated since 1.42, has been
  removed.
* Linker::makeExternalLink() has been deprecated in favor of
  LinkRenderer::makeExternalLink(), which has a improved API to help phan's
  SecurityCheckPlugin provide more accurate checks for escaping issues.
* Linker::makeHeadline(), Linker::generateTOC(), Linker::tocIndent(),
  Linker::tocUnindent(), Linker::tocLine(), Linker::tocLineEnd(), and
  Linker::tocList(), deprecated in 1.42, have been removed.
* Linker::formatComment(), Linker::formatLinksInComment(),
  Linker::commentBlock(), and Linker::revComment(), deprecated in 1.38,
  have been removed.
* UserCache::singleton(), deprecated in 1.43, now emits deprecation warnings.
  Use MediaWikiServices::getInstance()->getUserCache() instead.
* DummyLinker has been removed. The former DummyLinker parameter
  to the 'ImageBeforeProduceHTML' hook is now null.

* IMaintainableDatabase::textFieldSize() was removed without deprecation.
* ReplicatedBagOStuff, deprecated since 1.42, has been removed.
* The 'replicaOnly' option to SqlBagOStuff has been removed without deprecation.
  It existed for internal use by SqlBagOStuff only.
* Support for WinCache as local server cache has been removed, because WinCache
  is not available for supported versions of PHP. The WinCacheBagOStuff class
  has been removed. Use MediaWikiServices::getLocalServerObjectCache() instead,
  or the CACHE_ACCEL type instead, which automatically selects APCu when
  available.
  The "wincache" cache type (e.g. to ObjectCache::getInstance, and in
  "wg*CacheType" configuration) remains supported as an alias for CACHE_ACCEL.
* LockManager::sha1Base16Absolute(), has been removed without deprecation.
* The "options" parameter to User::createNew() and the $data parameter to
  UserOptionsManager::loadUserOptions() were removed.
* `.list-style-image()` mixin from mediawiki.mixins.less, deprecated since 1.38,
  has been removed.
* `.background-image()` mixin from mediawiki.mixins.less, deprecated since 1.38,
  has been removed.
* IDatabase::nextSequenceValue(), deprecated since 1.30, was removed.
* $wgAPIRequestLog was removed without deprecation. Use "api" and "api-request"
  wgDebugLogGroups channels or SPI instead.
* The setStats() method in MediaWiki\Rest\Router now expects a StatsFactory
  rather than a StatsdDataFactoryInterface. The method has been marked @internal
  and should not be called by extensions.
* All `@width-breakpoint-*` Less variables have been removed. Use
  `@min-width-breakpoint-*`/`@max-width-breakpoint-*` instead.
* The MessageContent class, deprecated since 1.38, is now removed. This also
  means that the Message::content() method is also removed.
* The following ParserOption methods, deprecated since 1.35, were removed:
  - ::setAllowExternalImages()
  - ::setAllowExternalImagesFrom()
  - ::setEnableImageWhitelist()
* Sanitizer::removeHTMLtags(), deprecated since 1.38, has been removed.
* OutputPage::getCSPNonce(), deprecated since 1.35, has been removed.
* UserMailer::rfc822Phrase(), deprecated since 1.38, has been removed.
* QueryPage::getSQL(), deprecated since 1.39, has been removed. The replacement
  QueryPage::getQueryInfo() is now abstract.
* update-keys.sql was removed. It is not recommended to install MediaWiki by
  manually sourcing SQL files, but if you are doing this, run
  `update.php --initial` instead of sourcing update-keys.sql.
* MediaWikiVersionFetcher, deprecated since 1.42 has been removed.
* Support for using Skin::addToBodyAttributes() method, which was deprecated
  in 1.35, has been removed. Use OutputPageBodyAttributesHook instead.
* Skins since 1.39 have not supported rendering content outside the body tag.
The bodyOnly=false option has now been removed, meaning this is no longer
supported.
* CentralIdLookup::factoryNonLocal(), deprecated since 1.37, has been removed.
* CryptHKDF and MWCryptHKDF were removed without deprecation, in part because no
  past or present use could be found. hash_hkdf() can be used instead of HKDF().
  While generate() and generateHex() have no direct replacement, random_bytes()
  and MWCryptRand::generateHex() can be used instead.

=== Deprecations in 1.43 ===

* The methods StatusValue::getErrors() and StatusValue::getErrorsByType(),
  as well as Status::getErrorsArray() and Status::getWarningsArray(), have
  been deprecated in favor of new method StatusValue::getMessages().
* PermissionManager::getPermissionErrors() has been deprecated in favor
  of getPermissionStatus().
* PermissionStatus::toLegacyErrorArray() is deprecated with no replacement.
* PermissionsError properties $errors and $permission are deprecated.
  To display the error, throw it or use ->report().
* (T166010) All PHP code in MediaWiki is slowly being moved to be in a class
  namespace as appropriate, so that we can use PSR-4 auto-loading, which will
  speed up general code loading of MediaWiki. The old global namespace class
  names are being left behind as deprecated aliases.

  class and the ParamType::OBJECT constant are likewise deprecated.
* Passing null or boolean values as message parameters, which are converted
  to strings "" and "1", is deprecated.
* The Less mixin .column-break-after-avoid() is deprecated. Use just the
  CSS rule `break-after: avoid-column;` instead now.

  constructor method in PageRestHelperFactory with the appropriate
  initialization arguments:
  * HtmlOutputRendererHelper::init()
  * HtmlMessageOutputHelper::init()
  * HtmlInputTransformHelper::init()
  Similarly, calling the constructor method in PageRestHelperFactory
  without the appropriate initialization arguments is now deprecated.
* Calling HtmlToContentTransform::setMetrics() and
  HtmlInputTransformHelper::setMetrics() with a StatsdDataFactoryInterface

  * mModuleStyles        - getModuleStyles() and addModuleStyles()
  * mJsConfigVars        - getJsConfigVars() and addJsConfigVars()

  - mEnableClientCache   - Set with enableClientCache() and disableClientCache()
  - mNewSectionLink      - Get with showNewSectionLink()
  - mHideNewSectionLink  - Set with forceHideNewSectionLink()

  corresponding methods on the ParserOutput returned from
  OutputPage::getMetadata() instead. (For example, instead of
  $output->setIndexPolicy() use $output->getMetadata()->setIndexPolicy().)
   - ::getIndexPolicy()
   - ::setIndexPolicy()  (setting 'index' after 'noindex' is deprecated)
   - ::getPreventClickjacking()
   - ::setPreventClickjacking()
* The hook OutputPageMakeCategoryLinks is deprecated. Use the new hook
  OutputPageRenderCategoryLink instead.
* mw.cookie.getCrossSite() has been deprecated due to the removal of
  $wgUseSameSiteLegacyCookies in MW 1.42. Use mw.cookie.get().
* The 'help' key in HTMLForm descriptors is deprecated. Use the 'help-raw'
  key instead.
* ImageGalleryBase::setWidths() and ::setHeights() will now emit a deprecation
  warning if they are called without ImageGalleryBase::setParser() having been
  called.  Please set the parser appropriately when using the image gallery.
* (T45646) The localisation messages 'copyright' and 'history_copyright' are
  deprecated in favor of 'copyright-footer' and 'copyright-footer-history'.
  The new messages are parsed as wikitext instead of being treated as raw HTML.
* (T45646) The hook 'SkinCopyrightFooter' is deprecated in favor of
  'SkinCopyrightFooterMessage'. The new hook allows specifying copyright
  messages that are parsed as wikitext instead of being treated as raw HTML.
* (T374314) The 'mw.Uri' module has been deprecated in favour of the browser-
  native URL interface, which is now provided in all supported user agents. For
  details, see <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL>.

   use getInstalledSkins instead.

=== Other changes in 1.43 ===

* Class aliases to support the old PHPUnit 4 style un-namespaced `PHPUnit_`
  classes (such as PHPUnit_Framework_Error) have been removed.
* [Temporary accounts] If $wgAutoCreateTempUser is enabled, then MediaWiki
  will create a temporary account and log the user in for unsuccessful edit
  attempts and null edits, in addition to edits that change content. This is
  a change from the previous paradigm, where temporary accounts were created
  only for successful edits. This change is done to support better logging
  support and moderation, to ensure that hooks run in a pre-save context have
  a user object to associate log entries and other actions with.
* Several entries have been removed from the default list of interwikis used
  when installing new wikis. This does not affect existing wikis.
* User auto-creations are now performed as the target user instead of
  anonymous IP user.
* [Temporary accounts] T359043 Temporary accounts for anonymous edits are
  enabled in DevelopmentSettings.php. To disable the feature, set
  `$wgAutoCreateTempUser['enabled'] = false;` in LocalSettings.php
* Corrected the interpretation of empty arrays in extension configuration when
  the default value is null. Previously, an empty array specified by the
  administrator would transform into the default null value. It now
