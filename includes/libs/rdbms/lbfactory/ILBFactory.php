 * A "cluster" is the set of database servers that manage a given dataset.
 *
 * The "core" clusters are meant to colocate the most basic and highly relational application
 * data for one or more "sister projects" managed by this site. This allows for highly flexible
 * queries. Each project is identified by a database domain. Note that if there are several
 * projects stored on a cluster, then the cluster dataset is a superset of the dataset for each
 * of those projects.
 *
 * The "external" clusters are meant to provide places for bulk text storage, to colocate bulky
 * relational data from specific modules, and to colocate data from cross-project modules such
 * as authentication systems. An external cluster can have a database/schema for each project.
