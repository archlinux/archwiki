/**
 * This class is a delegate to ILBFactory for a given database cluster
 *
 * ILoadBalancer tracks the database connections and transactions for a given database cluster.
 * A "cluster" is considered to be the set of database servers that manage a given dataset.
 * Within a given cluster, each database server can have one of the following roles:
 *  - sole-primary: the server used by this datacenter for writes from the application
 *  - co-primary: one of several servers used by this datacenter for writes from the application,
 *     relying on asynchronous replication to synchronize their copies of the dataset
 *  - replica: a server used only for reads from the application, relying on asynchronous
 *     replication to apply writes from the primary server or co-primary servers
 *  - static clone: a server that only accepts reads from the application, does not replicate,
 *     and has a copy of the final dataset, which must be static (all the servers reject writes)
 *
 * Single-datacenter database clusters consist of either:
 *   - A sole-primary server and zero or more replica servers
 *   - A set of static clone servers
 *
 * Multi-datacenter database clusters either consist of either:
 *   - A sole-primary server and zero or more replica servers in the "primary datacenter"
 *     (the one datacenter meant to handle requests/jobs that mutate the database), and zero or
 *     more replica servers in each "secondary datacenter" (all the other datacenters)
 *   - A co-primary server and zero or more replica servers within each datacenter
 *   - A set of static clone servers in each datacenter
 *
 * The term "primary" refers to the server used by this datacenter for handling writes,
 * whether it is a sole-primary or co-primary.
 *
 * The "servers" configuration array contains the list of database servers to use for operations
 * originating from the the local datacenter. The first entry must refer to the server to use for
 * write and read-for-write operations (e.g. the "writer server"):
 *   - If there is a primary server, then the first entry must refer to it, even if the primary
 *     server resides in a remote datacenter
 *   - If there are co-primary servers, then the first entry must refer to the one in the local
 *     datacenter
 *   - If the servers are static clones, then the first entry can refer to any of them, since the
 *     concept of a "writer server" is merely nominal
 *
 * On an infrastructure level, circular replication setups can have more than one database server
 * act as a replication "source" within the same datacenter, provided that no more than one of the
 * servers are writable at any time, namely the "writer server". The other source servers will be
 * treated as replicas by the load balancer, but can be quickly promoted to the "writer server" by
 * the site admin as needed.
 *
 * Likewise, Galera Cluster setups still require the choice of a single "writer server" for each
 * datacenter. Limiting the number of servers that initiate transactions helps reduce the rate of
 * aborted transactions due to wsrep conflicts.
 *
 * By default, each DB server uses DBO_DEFAULT for its 'flags' setting, unless explicitly set
 * otherwise in configuration. DBO_DEFAULT behavior depends on whether 'cliMode' is set:
 *   - In CLI mode, the flag has no effect with regards to LoadBalancer.
 *   - In non-CLI mode, the flag causes implicit transactions to be used; the first query on
 *     a database starts a transaction on that database. The transactions are meant to remain
 *     pending until either commitPrimaryChanges() or rollbackPrimaryChanges() is called. The
 *     application must have some point where it calls commitPrimaryChanges() near the end of
 *     the PHP request.
 * Every iteration of beginPrimaryChanges()/commitPrimaryChanges() is called a "transaction round".
 * Rounds are useful on the primary DB connections because they make single-DB (and by and large
 * multi-DB) updates in web requests all-or-nothing. Also, transactions on replica DBs are useful
 * when REPEATABLE-READ or SERIALIZABLE isolation is used because all foreign keys and constraints
 * hold across separate queries in the DB transaction since the data appears within a consistent
 * point-in-time snapshot.
 *
 * The typical caller will use LoadBalancer::getConnection( DB_* ) to yield a database
 * connection handle. The choice of which DB server to use is based on pre-defined loads for
 * weighted random selection, adjustments thereof by LoadMonitor, and the amount of replication
 * lag on each DB server. Lag checks might cause problems in certain setups, so they should be
 * tuned in the server configuration maps as follows:
 *   - Sole-primary + N Replica(s): set 'max lag' to an appropriate threshold for avoiding any
 *      replica database lagged by this much or more. If all replicas are this lagged, then the
 *      load balancer considers the cluster to be read-only.
 *   - Per-datacenter co-primary + N Replica(s): set 'max lag' to an appropriate threshold for
 *      avoiding any replica database lagged by this much or more. If all replicas are this
 *      lagged, then the load balancer considers the cluster to be read-only.
 *   - Read-only archive clones: set 'is static' in the server configuration maps. This will
 *      treat all such DBs as having 0 lag.
 *   - Externally updated dataset clones: set 'is static' in the server configuration maps.
 *      This will treat all such DBs as having 0 lag.
 *   - SQL load balancing proxy: any proxy should handle lag checks on its own, so the 'max lag'
 *      parameter should probably be set to INF in the server configuration maps. This will make
 *      the load balancer ignore whatever it detects as the lag of the logical replica is (which
 *      would probably just randomly bounce around).
 *
 * If using a SQL proxy service, it would probably be best to have two proxy hosts for the load
 * balancer to talk to. One would be the 'host' of the "writer server" entry and another for the
 * (logical) replica server entry. The proxy could map the load balancer's "replica" DB to any
 * number of physical replica DBs.

	 *      will be tried, left-to-right, until server index selection succeeds or all groups

	 *   - DB_PRIMARY: the primary server index will be used; the same as getWriterIndex().
	 *      The value of $groups should be [] when using this server index.
	 *   - Specific server index: a positive integer can be provided to use the server with
