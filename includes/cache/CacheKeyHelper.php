/**
 * Helper class for mapping value objects representing basic entities to cache keys.
 *
 * Rationale:
 * The logic for deriving the cache key should not be in the value object themselves for two reasons:
 * Firstly, the value object should not contain knowledge about caching or keys in general.
 * Secondly, all implementations of a given interface must have the exact same logic for deriving
 * the cache key. Otherwise, caches will break when different implementations are used when
 * interacting with a cache.
 *
 * Furthermore, the logic for deriving cache keys should not be in a service instance: there can
 * only ever be one implementation, it must not depend on configuration, and it should never change.
