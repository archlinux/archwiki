/**
 * Write logs to a syslog server, using RFC 3164 formatted UDP packets.
 *
 * This builds on Monolog's SyslogUdpHandler, which creates only a partial
 * RFC 5424 header (PRI and VERSION), with rest intending to come
 * from a specifically configured LineFormatter.
 *
 * This makes use of SyslogUdpHandler it impossible with a formatter like
 * \Monolog\Formatter\LogstashFormatter. Additionally, the direct syslog
 * input for Logstash requires and accepts only RFC 3164 formatted packets.
 *
 * This is a complete syslog handler and should work with any formatter. The
 * formatted message will be prepended with a complete RFC 3164 message
 * header and a partial message body. The resulting packet looks like:
 *
 *   <PRI>DATETIME HOSTNAME PROGRAM: MESSAGE
 *
 * This format works as input to rsyslog and can also be processed by the
 * default Logstash syslog input handler.
