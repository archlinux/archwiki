 * A foreign repo that allows for direct access to the foreign MW database.
 *
 * Extension file repos should implement this if they support making DB queries
 * against the foreign repos. Media handler extensions (e.g. TimedMediaHandler)
 * can look for this interface if they need to look up additional information.
 *
 * An extension will typically implement this by extending the LocalRepo class
 * and overriding these methods. If the foreign repo is meant to be non-writable,
 * the extension should additionally override LocalRepo::assertWritableRepo() and
 * throw an exception -- see ForeignDBRepo and ForeignDBViaLBRepo for examples.
