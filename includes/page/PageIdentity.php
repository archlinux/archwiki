/**
 * Interface for objects (potentially) representing an editable wiki page.
 *
 * The identity of any PageIdentity object is defined by the
 * namespace, the dbkey, and the wiki ID.
 * The page ID together with the wiki ID also identifies the page,
 * unless the page ID is 0.
 * If the wiki ID is self::LOCAL, the identity is relative to the local wiki.
 *
 * @note For compatibility with the Title class, PageIdentity instances
 *   may for now not only represent non-existing pages, but also things
 *   that are not actually pages, such as interwiki links, section links,
 *   or Special pages (which exist, but are not proper editable pages).
 *   This is intended to change in the future, so that a PageIdentity always
 *   represents a "proper" page. Until then, code that requires a proper page
 *   should call canExist() to check, or require a ProperPageIdentity.
 *   Eventually, ProperPageIdentity is intended to become an alias for
 *   PageIdentity.
 *
 * @note For compatibility with the Title class, PageIdentity instances may
 *   be mutable, and return different values from methods such as getId() or exist()
 *   at different times. In the future, the contract of this interface is intended
 *   to be changed to disallow this.
 *
 * @note Instances of Title shall be the only instances of PageIdentity that are not
 *   proper pages. Other classes implementing PageIdentity must represent proper pages,
 *   and also implement ProperPageIdentity. The idea is that once Title has been removed,
 *   all PageIdentities are then proper pages, and the distinction between PageIdentity
 *   and ProperPageIdentity becomes redundant.
 *
 * @note  Code that deserializes instances of PageIdentity must ensure that the original
 *   meaning of the "local" Wiki ID is preserved if the PageIdentity originated on
 *   another wiki.
 *
 * @stable to type
 * @since 1.36
