<dl><dd>So this is actually a weird semi-backdoor unblock request. User was blocked for their username, but after coming in to IRC asking why they were blocked it occurred to me (and a few other helpers) that the name isn't <i>that</i> provocative. Basically, I think the block was a little excessive but I don't want to wheel-war with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:331dot" title="User:331dot">331dot</a> over the matter. I figure since the block was entirely username-related that it would be reasonable to discuss the issue here. Thanks. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Primefac" title="User:Primefac">Primefac</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Primefac" title="User talk:Primefac">talk</a>) 15:18, 22 January 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul><li>I blocked in response to a <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AUsernames_for_administrator_attention&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=999688531&amp;oldid=999687981">UAA request</a>.  I also note that the user's unblock request without a username change was declined by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Yamla" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a>. The name references <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threesome" title="Threesome">Threesome</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_of_the_beast" title="Number of the beast">Number of the beast</a>(666). <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:331dot" title="User:331dot">331dot</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:331dot" title="User talk:331dot">talk</a>) 15:27, 22 January 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Right, which is why I'm somewhat on the fence. I get the 666 issue, but "threesome" to me is, well, not really that much of an issue in this day and age. I guess I just don't see 666 as enough of a problem to block; maybe I'm just weird. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Primefac" title="User:Primefac">Primefac</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Primefac" title="User talk:Primefac">talk</a>) 15:39, 22 January 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I guess at the time I felt that if one person was offended enough to report it that it was probably offensive, but if the community feels differently, I can live with that. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:331dot" title="User:331dot">331dot</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:331dot" title="User talk:331dot">talk</a>) 15:41, 22 January 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li>
<li>The sexual reference is mild. "666" on its own is not offensive at all. I suppose it the combination of the two that is the issue?

<li>I personally wouldn't have blocked for the username on its own. If I'd seen the username and just looked at <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Horned_God&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=967550364">this</a> edit though, and seen the signature, I might have blocked as not being here for the right reasons. I wouldn't however have a problem with someone of that username gnoming around in American football articles, which seems to be their primary interest. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Girth_Summit" title="User:Girth Summit"><span style="font-family:Impact;color:#006400;">Girth</span><span style="font-family:Impact;color:#4B0082;">Summit</span></a><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Girth_Summit" title="User talk:Girth Summit"><sub style="font-family:Segoe print;color:blue;"> (blether)</sub></a> 15:48, 22 January 2021 (UTC)</li></ul>

Like with a Threesome-this or an Orgy-that or whatever. I don't think it reflects well on the project to have usernames like those around. I don't want kids to see that. While the more <i>intellectually</i> potent usernames will just go over their heads, the more direct crass sex stuff has little if any utility. We gotta use common sense when weighing <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CENSOR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CENSOR">WP:CENSOR</a> against <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTFREESPEECH" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTFREESPEECH">WP:NOTFREESPEECH</a>.

Significantly, the blocked user reacted by saying: <link rel="mw-deduplicated-inline-style" href="mw-data:TemplateStyles:r989825325"/><q class="inline-quote-talk">My screen name is my name and represents me.

<dl><dd>Reasonable argument (and most of those were things I tried to discuss with them as reasons why they were blocked). For what it's worth I'm willing to be convinced in either direction. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Primefac" title="User:Primefac">Primefac</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Primefac" title="User talk:Primefac">talk</a>) 15:52, 22 January 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Primefac" title="User:Primefac">Primefac</a>, I guess what I'm getting at is that we should be wary of anything too <i>explicit</i>: like really ghoulish or of a sexual nature or about bodily fluids or whatever. I realize many kids are exposed to much worse, but there are still many kids whose internet is closely regulated by their parents and who may have safeguards to prevent their kids from reading the actual Wikipedia article on these subjects. We should not betray the trust of those parents who allow their kids to be "gnoming around in American football articles," which <i>ought</i> to be an innocent enough affair. Wikipedia is, ultimately, a <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:ENC" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:ENC">scholarly</a></i> pursuit (serious bizness!<abbr title="Kitty" style="border-bottom: none;"><img alt="Kitty emoji.png" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Kitty_emoji.png/18px-Kitty_emoji.png" decoding="async" width="18" height="18" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Kitty_emoji.png/27px-Kitty_emoji.png 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Kitty_emoji.png/36px-Kitty_emoji.png 2x" data-file-width="180" data-file-height="180" /></abbr>), but why not be welcoming of everyone? The tradeoff looks intuitive to me and it falls squarely on the side of being respectful (of the sensibilities of kids — as for adults, fuck'em). <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:El_C" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 16:21, 22 January 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I wouldn't have blocked this username myself, had I noticed it first. That said, I don't think the block was inappropriate. This is a judgment call, and the username is certainly skirting the edges. I declined the unblock request because it wasn't a request to be unblocked, as far as I can see, but rather a declaration that they don't plan to edit further. Totally unrelated, I found <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threesome_(1994_film)" title="Threesome (1994 film)">Threesome (1994 film)</a> rather entertaining. --<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Yamla" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a> (<a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Yamla" title="User talk:Yamla">talk</a>) 16:36, 22 January 2021 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I think what I'm talking about here is probably a more amorphous principle, because, like <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Yamla" title="User:Yamla">Yamla</a>, I don't know if I would have blocked that username, either (as <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:331dot" title="User:331dot">331dot</a> says, absent a complaint). Because as far as sex stuff usernames go, it is indeed rather tame. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:El_C" title="User:El C">El_C</a> 16:53, 22 January 2021 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<li><b>Bad block</b> for a user registered in <i>2005</i> with a questionable-at-worst username and no attempt at discussion.
