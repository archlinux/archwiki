We need to have a limit for how many accounts that new tool users can create per day by default. When a tool user shows proficiency with handling requests correctly, they can apply for and (after approval by an ACC admin via a comment made to the request) be granted the account creator flag in order to remove those limits. Option 2 would remove the need for an ACC tool administrator to give their approval before an admin can grant the user rights to the requesting user. This approval is still necessary and absolutely needed. Raising the current limit of 4 creations per day to 10 creations per day would loosen the restrictions so that users can help take care of the current backlog of requests at ACC, while still being on a set limit during the time that they're learning and demonstrating their knowledge and proficiency with ACC tool user interface.

The current method of granting the right after a couple weeks of activity allows the team to gauge the user's performance and whether or not they have learned the policies and procedures properly. Lowering the barrier further could lead to a problematic user potentially causing a lot more damage (no rate-limit, anti-spoof override, username title blacklist override) than they otherwise could if we had to manually grant those rights.

Because I have got a following problem in the Ukrainian Wiki: few months ago I discovered that many templates there still contained old, Russian-style inline documentation translusions (Russians use their own documentation style, and there is a special template for inline documentation). So I replaced all those inline documentation transclusions with {{<a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Documentation\" title=\"Template:Documentation\">Documentation</a>}} and the parameter |content=, but there were some cases with tables. Despite solving this problem by creating subpages, I think that it would still be helpful if a special inline documentation template is created. For example, in that <a class=\"external text\" href=\"https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/Користувач:ɪ/d-l\">link</a> from a user's sandbox you can see a situation where it can be very useful to have such an option, as you don't need to create an extra docpage. <a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BD:Doc-inline\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"ru:Шаблон:Doc-inline\">That</a> Russian template enables this option.",

In my browser, I can see the Unicode point number of characters I don't have fonts for, but I'm not sure about other editors. This began as part of a spell checking and Manual of Style compliance project. I'm trying to bundle HTML entity cleanup with any punctuation cleanup on the same articles, so there aren't a bunch of minor commits. Right now I'm working on a list of only about 5,000 articles; in some cases, the HTML entities represent breakage so there's reader-visible cleanup to do, but you're right it's often only editor-visible. I've been getting occasional thanks for the entity cleanup, though; where done right it makes the wikitext a lot more readable, especially to editors who don't know HTML. (For example, café is a lot easier to read and edit than caf&amp;#xC9;.) I had a conversation with some MOS editors before starting this, and there was a strong consensus in favor of converting numeric HTML entities where possible, unless the result would be confusing, and I made a list of confusing situations to exclude. Unfortunately, Unicode is a huge place and no one thought about potential problems with combining characters (I'm leaving those alone after editors on some Arabic-langugage-related pages rightfully complained) or the private use area or a handful of other things where I'm trying to building bottom-up consensus. I'm leaning toward PUA characters being too confusing to convert, so I'll add them to my exclusion list unless someone here would much rather see real characters than numeric entities? Ah, I see <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:PUA\" title=\"Template:PUA\">Template:PUA</a> actually says not to convert them; that's also a page that will probably give a comprehensive list of articles they are used in, if anyone wants to go around pruning any unnecessary ones.",

My interest, therefore, is finding an automated way (i.e. without human edits or bot edits) to detect a post-block addition of an external link, the results of which could be evaluated as spam or not-spam by a human.  I'm envisioning the following criteria:\n</p>\n<ul><li>User has been indefinitely blocked for spamming — detect because user is indefinitely blocked, and either rationale or talk page has {{<a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Uw-spamblock\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Template:Uw-spamblock\">uw-spamblock</a>}} or some other \"you have been blocked for spamming\" template</li>\n<li>After block is performed, user edits talk page and adds an external link</li>\n<li>If user has added {{<a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Unblock\" title=\"Template:Unblock\">unblock</a>}}, the external link is not inside the unblock template</li></ul>\n<p>Obviously this kind of thing happens sometimes, but I have no clue how often; in case it's a rare event, I don't want to request an edit filter and tie up system resources.

It can trigger loading one of well-defined set of scripts, and this set is vetted with the same level of caution used for vetting whatever goes into common.js</li>\n<li>The system uses a small code snippet in common.js, and a special template for triggering the \"on-demand\" switch. The code on ruwiki is the 11 lines, beginning at line #325 in <a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki:Common.js\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"ru:Mediawiki:Common.js\">ru:Mediawiki:Common.js</a>, and the template is in <a href=\"https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:%D0%92%D1%8B%D0%BF%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%82%D1%8C_%D1%81%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%82\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"ru:Template:Выполнить скрипт\">ru:Template:Выполнить скрипт</a>. i will call it {{Load script}}.</li>\n<li>The machinery is super simple: the \"Load script\" template creates a hidden element, with a specific class (\"ExecuteJS\"), and a data attribute that contains the name of the requested script. The common.js code scans the page for elements with this class, and if found, it extracts the script name from the data attribute, and then loads <code>Mediawiki:Script/&lt;scriptname>.js</code>. The sysops make sure only sanctioned scripts will get to be in \"Mediawiki/Script/\", with the same level of scrutiny they use for Common.js</li>\n<li>A template that desire to load a script which, e.g., adds some special behavior to \"imagemap\", will include something like {{ Load script | imagemap-enhancer }}. When a page transcludes this template, the script <code>Mediawiki:Script/imagemap-enhancer.js</code> will be loaded. This way, ruwiki can \"enhance\" imagemaps, without adding bloat to any page that _does not_ transclude this template (i.e., all but a handful of pages).</li>\n<li>In hewiki, we tweaked this system a little bit (line #261-275 in <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediawiki:Common.js\" class=\"extiw\" title=\"he:Mediawiki:Common.js\">he:Mediawiki:Common.js</a>) , to allow loading of gadgets, as well as scripts (the gadget name must begin with \"ondemand\", so this can't be used to sneakily load any \"normal\" gadget that the reader did not enable - only one of very few  sanctioned \"ondemand\" gadgets)</li></ul>\n<p>I hope this description is good enough for <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Izno\" title=\"User:Izno\">User:Izno</a> to overcome their opposition. I wanted to present this mechanism to the technical community on enwiki, but it's not absolutely essential: it's possible to avoid the bloat by taking the following steps:\n</p>\n<dl><dt>one-off alternative to generic \"on-demand\" loading</dt></dl>\n<ul><li>Create a \"hidden\" gadget with the script (hidden gadgets can't be selected by users, and unless you mark them \"default\", they never load)</li>\n<li>Have a small snippet in common.js that looks approximately like so: <div class=\"mw-highlight mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"nx\">$</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"kd\">function</span><span class=\"p\">()</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"k\">if</span> <span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"nx\">$</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s1\">'.pgn-source-wrapper'</span><span class=\"p\">).</span><span class=\"nx\">length</span> <span class=\"o\">></span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"nx\">mw</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">loader</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">load</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"s1\">'ext.gadget.pgnviewer'</span> <span class=\"p\">);</span> <span class=\"c1\">//\"manually\" load the hidden gadget</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">}</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span> <span class=\"p\">);</span>\n</pre></div></li></ul>\n<p>This will achieve the same objective: The script will load if and only if it should load, so if enwiki will have, say, 578 articles which want to show interactive chess game, the script will load for readers only when they view one of those pages, and the other 4M+ articles will not have to pay the bloat. peace</p>",

You don't have to do any math (yes, I know about the birthday paradox) to decide that's abysmally bad randomness.  I suspect the feature was originally intended to service the needs of somebody randomly browsing the encyclopedia.  It's probably fine for that.  For servicing a work queue, not so much.\n</p><p>Not only is this not very random, but the process tends towards increasingly less random results over time.  The most likely draft to be selected by somebody trolling for work is the one with the largest gap in page_random values.  So, that's the one that's most likely to either be deleted, or promoted to mainspace.  Either of which results in an even larger page_random gap!  Of course, the other side of that is when a new draft is created, it's most likely to fall into the largest existing gap.\n</p><p>My statistics-fu isn't strong enough to figure out if those two effects cancel each other out, but I did write a little python program to simulate adding and deleting drafts using a similar algorithm.  Starting with an initial pool of 4000 drafts, I did 100,000 iterations of deleting a draft and adding another one.  I found all the gaps, and printed the stdev of the gaps every 10,000 iterations:\n</p>\n<pre>0.000249\n0.000489\n0.000508\n0.000544\n0.000573\n0.000536\n0.000559\n0.000568\n0.000563\n0.000599\n</pre>\n<p>That's pretty typical across many runs.  That says to me (the self-professed statistical idiot) that the longer you manage the draft work queue with this process, the less uniform the gap distribution will become, and thus lead to the behavior I'm seeing.\n</p><p>Assuming the above makes any sense at all, I think we need a better way to manage the draft work queue.\n</p><p></p>",

Upon talking to the play testers, the real complaint was the toy serving up the same random selection two or three times in a row. So instead of rewriting the RNG, I just had it remember the last eight results and \"roll again\" if the latest selection was on the list of recent results. My point is that the people reporting the problem didn't know that this was the solution, and instead asked me to \"make the selection more random\" I actually made it slighly <i>less</i> random, but I solved the real problem.</p>\n<p>So just report the test results without any assumption about what the answer should be, and let the developers pick a solution.</p>",

Instead it looks at the date the first and last page was added to the category, and then picks a random time somewhere between those two, in order to find a page. Since date added to a category is distributed non-uniformly, this is generally not random. At the time, it was felt that this method, although severely flawed was better than nothing.",

With page_random, the biggest gaps tend to get split into smaller ones as new pages get added to the category, as noted above.  In fact, once I realized that, I no longer had much confidence that my analysis made sense, but the behavioral observation was still valid.  If you're using date added, that's monotonically increasing.  Existing gaps never get split, they just keep getting bigger as entries are removed from the category.

And if the stadium was built in 1934, then information on the countries that existed on the territory of modern Belarus is indicated on the Wikimedia Commons. These countries and their parts were in the 1930s, but now they are no longer there. And on the page of the stadium on the Wikimedia Commons they are indicated, which misleads the reader.

If the desire is to find or count strings in the source, then I think that a module is required.  Not tested but something like this:</p><div class=\"mw-highlight mw-content-ltr\" dir=\"ltr\"><pre>local page_title_object;\n\nif frame.args[2] then\n\tpage_title_object = mw.title.new(frame.args[2]);\t\t\t\t\t\t-- title object for the page specified in the template call\nelse\n\tpage_title_object = mw.title.getCurrentTitle();\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-- title object for the current page\nend\n\nlocal text = page_title_object:getContent();\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t-- the unparsed content of the selected page\nlocal _;\nlocal count;\n_, count = mw.ustring.gsub (text, frame.args[1], '%1');\t\t\t\t\t\t-- count number of occurrences of frame.args[1] in frame.args[2]\nreturn count;</pre></div>\n<p>not tested.  Probably requires that Lua pattern sequences in <code>frame.args[1]</code> (the string to be found or counted) are escaped.  Likely other stuff needs doing.</p>\n<p></p>",

I usually work on laptop, and there I am logged in all the time (I choose the option to log in for 180 days). On my Ipad, I used to be logged on all the time as well. Sometimes it behaved strangely: For example, a year ago I found myself in a situation when I was logged in the English Wikipedia but was not logged in for example on Commons; then I logged in to Commons as well and all was fine. A week ago, my Ipad installed an automatic update which presumably included a new version of Safari. I found myself logged out. I tried to log in and found that I can log in just into one project, but if I then open a new window with any Wikimedia project, I am not logged in. I can login there as well, but then the next window is not logged in and so on. Moreover, if I am logged in say to the English Wikipedia I can work all right (well, making sure I never backtrack to the login screen). However, after two days, I find myself not logged in. Every time I log in I tick the \"180 days\" option. I would appreciate any comments. Thanks.",
