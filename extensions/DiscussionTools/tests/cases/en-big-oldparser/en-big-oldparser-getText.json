I've checked all the different tickets that were mentioned in these threads on this common problem and they are either marked as a) closed, resolved, b) closed, duplicate or c) low priority. I don't see how this issue can be considered resolved when it continues to be a problem and it is disappointing to think that there is little to no chance that anyone will work on actually solving this problem. It's clear that a lot of work on this started last year, but then the ticket was mistakenly closed as resolved. Is there any way to restart the process of review so that there is some investigation of this problem?

Some were closed as duplicate, because they were what the label says; even here, I believe we don't like 'duplicate.' The main task now is at phab:T221795. However, (for me to not be too evasive) I admit the problem is not given any sense of urgency from the technical side, but that's easily explainable. To be frank, there's nothing broken if category count is not correct. The problem has been noticed since 2008 or possibly earlier, and with adhoc fixes, everyone moves on until it returns and annoys another person. It's something obscure and which almost entire Wikipedia readers probably don't use nor care about. The editors who care for it (the count) are few, and even fewer know the problem exists.

According to what I read, Facebook adds these to track users' browsing behavior. It works like this: Let's assume I discover something on www.example.com/cooltopic.html and share this URL with a friend on Facebook: \"HEY CHEK THIS OUT!!!!!!!11\" Facebook automatically adds a unique FaceBook CLick ID (fbclid) to every link that is passed through them by adding &fbclid=... or ?fbclid=... to it. This doesn't change the destination of the link i.e. the URL still works the same. The friend decides to add my URL as a reference/link to Wikipedia. Except, now the URL will read www.example.com/cooltopic.html?fbclid=xyz123. Thanks to their Click ID Facebook can now track the URL: If the link is emailed to a 3rd person, who sends it to a 4th via Whatsapp, Facebook recognizes the (modified) link as the one I originally shared with my friend, thus gathering data about which persons are communicating with whom. If the destination site of the link (example.com) has added a like-button to their page then Facebook even gets notified whenever anyone follows the link, i.e. they will know exactly which visits to www.example.com are a consequence of my original communication with my friend. (They use this to find out who is a valuable influencer.) Long story short, IMHO all fbclid=... should be deleted from all (current and future) references and links on Wikipedia, because Facebook has no business tracking Wikipedia contributors or readers. The huge fbclid=... strings make references harder to read and edit. The fact that an Wikipedia article's reference's URL was passed through Facebook's infrastructure earlier is not relevant to the topic the article covers, so this information need not be preserved. The links work just the same after deleting the fbclid parameter. So it would be great if some Wikipedia wizard could program and unleash a bot for this? Please?? Supposedly there are also Google Click IDs and others, however I haven't found their 'additions' in links. Maybe there is already a bot in place filtering them out?

We need to have a limit for how many accounts that new tool users can create per day by default. When a tool user shows proficiency with handling requests correctly, they can apply for and (after approval by an ACC admin via a comment made to the request) be granted the account creator flag in order to remove those limits. Option 2 would remove the need for an ACC tool administrator to give their approval before an admin can grant the user rights to the requesting user. This approval is still necessary and absolutely needed. Raising the current limit of 4 creations per day to 10 creations per day would loosen the restrictions so that users can help take care of the current backlog of requests at ACC, while still being on a set limit during the time that they're learning and demonstrating their knowledge and proficiency with ACC tool user interface.

The bot is described at d:Wikidata:Requests for permissions/Bot/Emijrpbot 6, which points to code here. The function of the bot is to add new wikidata items for new en.wiki biographies and/or to add human and/or gender statements to existing wikidata items, based on articles found on Special:UnconnectedPages. WiR bases all of its metrics (& these) on wikidata records for en.wiki articles, and since end April the project's stats have become increasingly hard to compile.

Because I have got a following problem in the Ukrainian Wiki: few months ago I discovered that many templates there still contained old, Russian-style inline documentation translusions (Russians use their own documentation style, and there is a special template for inline documentation). So I replaced all those inline documentation transclusions with {{Documentation}} and the parameter |content=, but there were some cases with tables. Despite solving this problem by creating subpages, I think that it would still be helpful if a special inline documentation template is created. For example, in that link from a user's sandbox you can see a situation where it can be very useful to have such an option, as you don't need to create an extra docpage.

You can see an example of this in my sandbox: This sandbox shows the first paragraph from the body of Wikipedia copied from edit mode. This sandbox shows the same paragraph copied without entering edit mode. It would be useful to have an edit filter or some other way to indicate when this happens. This is something I always tell new users, but which people very regularly forget about, just to introduce improperly formatted content into an article when trying to copy out of a sandbox.

In my browser, I can see the Unicode point number of characters I don't have fonts for, but I'm not sure about other editors. This began as part of a spell checking and Manual of Style compliance project. I'm trying to bundle HTML entity cleanup with any punctuation cleanup on the same articles, so there aren't a bunch of minor commits. Right now I'm working on a list of only about 5,000 articles; in some cases, the HTML entities represent breakage so there's reader-visible cleanup to do, but you're right it's often only editor-visible. I've been getting occasional thanks for the entity cleanup, though; where done right it makes the wikitext a lot more readable, especially to editors who don't know HTML. (For example, café is a lot easier to read and edit than caf&#xC9;.) I had a conversation with some MOS editors before starting this, and there was a strong consensus in favor of converting numeric HTML entities where possible, unless the result would be confusing, and I made a list of confusing situations to exclude. Unfortunately, Unicode is a huge place and no one thought about potential problems with combining characters (I'm leaving those alone after editors on some Arabic-langugage-related pages rightfully complained) or the private use area or a handful of other things where I'm trying to building bottom-up consensus. I'm leaning toward PUA characters being too confusing to convert, so I'll add them to my exclusion list unless someone here would much rather see real characters than numeric entities? Ah, I see Template:PUA actually says not to convert them; that's also a page that will probably give a comprehensive list of articles they are used in, if anyone wants to go around pruning any unnecessary ones.",

	"c-Headbomb-2019-08-07T17:24:00.000Z-Bots_Newsletter,_August_2019": "Bots Newsletter, August 2019 Greetings! Here is the 7th issue of the Bots Newsletter, a lot happened since last year's newsletter! You can subscribe/unsubscribe from future newsletters by adding/removing your name from this list. Highlights for this newsletter include: ARBCOM Nothing of note happened. Just like we like it. BAG Several (1 + 12 = 13) users have been retired/resigned from the BAG due to inactivity, per our new activity requirements (discussion). BAG members are expected to be active on Wikipedia to have their finger on the pulse of the community. After two years without any bot-related activity (such as posting on bot-related pages, posting on a bot's talk page, or operating a bot), BAG members will be retired from BAG following a one-week notice. Retired members can re-apply for BAG membership as normal if they wish to rejoin the BAG. Two BAG members retired Madman (talk · contribs) retired. BU Rob13 (talk · contribs) vanished and retired. Three new BAG members have been voted in, welcome to the BAG! Primefac (talk · contribs) joined on 2018-12-12 (RfBAG). Primefac operates PrimeBOT (talk · contribs) which does a plethora of tasks. TheSandDoctor (talk · contribs) joined on 2019-01-21 (RfBAG). TheSandDoctor operates several bots including DeprecatedFixerBot (talk · contribs). Enterprisey (talk · contribs) joined on 2019-08-07 (RfBAG). Enterprisey operates EnterpriseyBot (talk · contribs), which does a plethora of tasks, RemindMeBot (talk · contribs) which posts reminders, and codes several scripts. We thank former members for their service and wish Madman a happy retirement. We note that Madman and BU Rob13 were not inactive and could resume their BAG positions if they so wished, should their retirements happens to be temporary. BOTDICT Two new entries feature in the bots dictionary Editor-hostile wikitext – describes wikitext structuring that is editor hostile, even if it renders correctly Spectrum of usefulness – describes how tasks are deemed useful or not BOTPOL Activity requirements: BAG members now have an activity requirement. The requirements are very light, one only needs to be involved in a bot-related area at some point within the last two years. For purpose of meeting these requirements, discussing a bot-related matter anywhere on Wikipedia counts, as does operating a bot (RFC). Copyvio flag: Bot accounts may be additionally marked by a bureaucrat upon BAG request as being in the \"copyviobot\" user group on Wikipedia. This flag allows using the API to add metadata to edits for use in the New pages feed (discussion). There is currently 1 bot using this functionality. Mass creation: The restriction on mass-creation (semi-automated or automated) was extended from articles, to all content-pages. There are subtleties, but content here broadly means whatever a reader could land on when browsing the mainspace in normal circumstances (e.g. Mainspace, Books, most Categories, Portals, ...). There is also a warning that WP:MEATBOT still applies in other areas (e.g. Redirects, Wikipedia namespace, Help, maintenance categories, ...) not explicitely covered by WP:MASSCREATION. BOTREQs and BRFAs As of writing, we have... 20 active BOTREQs, please help if you can! 14 open BRFAs and 1 BRFA in need of BAG attention (see live status). In 2018, 96 bot task were approved. An AWB search shows approximately 29 were withdrawn/expired, and 6 were denied. Since the start of 2019, 97 bot task were approved. Logs show 15 were withdrawn/expired, and 15 were denied. 10 inactive bots have been deflagged (see discussion). 5 other bots have been deflagged per operator requests or similar (see discussion). New things All bot-related discussion pages now have a centralized and searchable archive box (see discussion). Discussions are searchable per noticeboard, or globally. {{Bot}} now supports |status=expired (see discussion). This led to the deletion of Category:Indefinitely blocked Wikipedia bots as useless (see discussion). WP:BOTREQ now mentions WP:SCRIPTREQ and WP:AWBTASKS as alternatives to bot requests. The bot creation guide now mentions bot flags, and two new languages Awk and MATLAB. Other minor tweaks have been made. AAlertBot has received major code updates. In particular, WP:AALERTS will now report splits, mergers, and AFC submissions. Citation bot has received several updates (User talk:Citation bot/Archive 10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17). In particular, the bot stopped the automated removal of |publisher= from {{cite journal}}, and stopped the automated addition of CiteSeerX links, and now uses OAuth to authenticate those who make requests of the bot. Other discussions These are some of the discussions that happened / are still happening since the last Bots Newsletter. Many are stale, but some are still active.

However, many editors from various projects told us that it would make more sense to have the link in the “In other projects” section, since Wikidata is one of the Wikimedia projects and the Wikidata item link doesn’t really belong to the list of special pages. This is why we are going to change the position of the link, on August 22nd for all Wikipedias and August 21st for all the other projects. After this date, you will find the “Wikidata item” link in the “In other projects” section. In some cases, for example on help and meta pages, the section may contain two links to Wikidata, for example on Help:Contents where there will be the “Wikidata” link (linking to d:Help:Contents) and the “Wikidata item” link (linking to d:Q914807).

On one hand, I don't want to shut down access without evidence of abuse, but on the other hand, it's possible that the talk page would be used abusively. My interest, therefore, is finding an automated way (i.e. without human edits or bot edits) to detect a post-block addition of an external link, the results of which could be evaluated as spam or not-spam by a human. I'm envisioning the following criteria: User has been indefinitely blocked for spamming — detect because user is indefinitely blocked, and either rationale or talk page has {{uw-spamblock}} or some other \"you have been blocked for spamming\" template After block is performed, user edits talk page and adds an external link If user has added {{unblock}}, the external link is not inside the unblock template Obviously this kind of thing happens sometimes, but I have no clue how often; in case it's a rare event, I don't want to request an edit filter and tie up system resources.

	"c-קיפודנחש-2019-07-31T23:41:00.000Z-\"on_demand\"_loading_of_scripts_and_gadgets": "I'd like to describe the \"on demand loading\" mechanism used on ruwiki, hewiki, and others (e.g., runews, ukwiki and more). So, most of our site-specific code has to do with utilities meant mainly for editors, but there are some scripts which affect the content, for reading. An example on enwiki is the part in mediawiki:common.js that deals with collapsing, and the part that executes special code when reading the main page. In many cases, this special code is only relevant on minority of the content pages: for instance, most pages on enwiki do not need the special code that deals with \"collapse\" css classes. In this case, the code itself is short, so loading it whether it's needed or not makes little difference. However, some other projects want to load longer scripts affecting the content for reading. The pgn viewer discussed above is one such example. The wikipedians on ruwiki created a simple mechanism to support this, and i'd like to describe it here. In this context, \"on demand\" means \"template-controlled\": so a template can \"instruct\" the system to load a script which is not normally loaded, when the template contains some element that needs this extra juice. The system can't load \"any arbitrary script\". It can trigger loading one of well-defined set of scripts, and this set is vetted with the same level of caution used for vetting whatever goes into common.js The system uses a small code snippet in common.js, and a special template for triggering the \"on-demand\" switch. The code on ruwiki is the 11 lines, beginning at line #325 in ru:Mediawiki:Common.js, and the template is in ru:Template:Выполнить скрипт. i will call it {{Load script}}. The machinery is super simple: the \"Load script\" template creates a hidden element, with a specific class (\"ExecuteJS\"), and a data attribute that contains the name of the requested script. The common.js code scans the page for elements with this class, and if found, it extracts the script name from the data attribute, and then loads Mediawiki:Script/<scriptname>.js. The sysops make sure only sanctioned scripts will get to be in \"Mediawiki/Script/\", with the same level of scrutiny they use for Common.js A template that desire to load a script which, e.g., adds some special behavior to \"imagemap\", will include something like {{ Load script | imagemap-enhancer }}. When a page transcludes this template, the script Mediawiki:Script/imagemap-enhancer.js will be loaded. This way, ruwiki can \"enhance\" imagemaps, without adding bloat to any page that _does not_ transclude this template (i.e., all but a handful of pages). In hewiki, we tweaked this system a little bit (line #261-275 in he:Mediawiki:Common.js) , to allow loading of gadgets, as well as scripts (the gadget name must begin with \"ondemand\", so this can't be used to sneakily load any \"normal\" gadget that the reader did not enable - only one of very few sanctioned \"ondemand\" gadgets) I hope this description is good enough for User:Izno to overcome their opposition. I wanted to present this mechanism to the technical community on enwiki, but it's not absolutely essential: it's possible to avoid the bloat by taking the following steps: one-off alternative to generic \"on-demand\" loading Create a \"hidden\" gadget with the script (hidden gadgets can't be selected by users, and unless you mark them \"default\", they never load) Have a small snippet in common.js that looks approximately like so: $( function() { if ( $('.pgn-source-wrapper').length > 0) { mw.loader.load( 'ext.gadget.pgnviewer' ); //\"manually\" load the hidden gadget } } ); This will achieve the same objective: The script will load if and only if it should load, so if enwiki will have, say, 578 articles which want to show interactive chess game, the script will load for readers only when they view one of those pages, and the other 4M+ articles will not have to pay the bloat. peace",

I would agree with Izno that it would be nice if things like these were implemented as an extension rather than as a gadget, but making something to an extension would certainly delay this considerably and possibly make it so no solution is ever implemented.",

I found some threads (here and here) that explain about how RandomInCategory works (i.e. indexing pre-generated page_random values). I get that it's fast, but boy, does it produce poor results. I just pulled up 25 \"random\" drafts, and got: Draft:Declan Meagher Draft:Gary Soulz Draft:Ananth Narayanan Draft:Frank Verboven Draft:Maths Time Joy Draft:Gary Soulz Draft:Ananth Narayanan Draft:Eni Vasili Draft:Shorts México - Mexico International Short Film Festival Category:Pending AfC submissions in userspace Draft:John Haze Draft:Alisha Rai (author) Draft:Leonardo3 Museum Draft:Wake. (2018 film) Category:Pending AfC submissions in article space Draft:Anastasiya Makarevich Draft:Alisha Rai (author) User:ItsYaBoiAustin/sandbox/Odyssey: Extraction Draft:Scott Stambach Draft:Christian Lillinger Draft:Gudula Naiga Basaza Draft:Scott Stambach Draft:Katherine Boyer Draft:Walter Ferguson Draft:Faryal Mehmood Not only are there four duplicates: Draft:Scott Stambach Draft:Gary Soulz Draft:Ananth Narayanan Draft:Alisha Rai (author) but two pairs of duplicates in the same order: Draft:Gary Soulz Draft:Ananth Narayanan There's \"approximately 4,581\" entries in Category:Pending AfC submissions. You don't have to do any math (yes, I know about the birthday paradox) to decide that's abysmally bad randomness. I suspect the feature was originally intended to service the needs of somebody randomly browsing the encyclopedia. It's probably fine for that. For servicing a work queue, not so much. Not only is this not very random, but the process tends towards increasingly less random results over time. The most likely draft to be selected by somebody trolling for work is the one with the largest gap in page_random values. So, that's the one that's most likely to either be deleted, or promoted to mainspace. Either of which results in an even larger page_random gap! Of course, the other side of that is when a new draft is created, it's most likely to fall into the largest existing gap. My statistics-fu isn't strong enough to figure out if those two effects cancel each other out, but I did write a little python program to simulate adding and deleting drafts using a similar algorithm. Starting with an initial pool of 4000 drafts, I did 100,000 iterations of deleting a draft and adding another one. I found all the gaps, and printed the stdev of the gaps every 10,000 iterations: 0.000249 0.000489 0.000508 0.000544 0.000573 0.000536 0.000559 0.000568 0.000563 0.000599 That's pretty typical across many runs. That says to me (the self-professed statistical idiot) that the longer you manage the draft work queue with this process, the less uniform the gap distribution will become, and thus lead to the behavior I'm seeing.

I remember a toy I worked on a a while back (think very limited amount of RAM and processing power) where the complain was that a particular \"random choice\" didn't feel random enough. Upon talking to the play testers, the real complaint was the toy serving up the same random selection two or three times in a row. So instead of rewriting the RNG, I just had it remember the last eight results and \"roll again\" if the latest selection was on the list of recent results. My point is that the people reporting the problem didn't know that this was the solution, and instead asked me to \"make the selection more random\" I actually made it slighly less random, but I solved the real problem. So just report the test results without any assumption about what the answer should be, and let the developers pick a solution.",

Instead it looks at the date the first and last page was added to the category, and then picks a random time somewhere between those two, in order to find a page.

With page_random, the biggest gaps tend to get split into smaller ones as new pages get added to the category, as noted above. In fact, once I realized that, I no longer had much confidence that my analysis made sense, but the behavioral observation was still valid. If you're using date added, that's monotonically increasing. Existing gaps never get split, they just keep getting bigger as entries are removed from the category.

I would like to draw the attention of Wikipedia administrators one inaccuracy in the template for Belarusian stadiums on the Wikimedia Commons. In the LOCATION field, instead of the current 2019 administrative-territorial structure of the country outdated information from the year of construction of the sports facility is indicated. It turns out such nonsense: Dynama Stadium, Minsk built in 1934, but instead of a location in the country BELARUS, the card in the description indicates the states that existed in the 1930s on the territory of modern BELARUS — Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. Same thing with Central Stadium, Gomel. The stadium was built in the 1920s, but Gomel Povet and Mogilyov Viceroyalty no longer exists. By administrative-territorial structure of the Republic of BELARUS for 2019 all cities is part of the district, then the region, then the country. The capital city of Minsk is a separate administrative unit within BELARUS. In this regard, I ask administrators to make the necessary changes to the card on the Wikimedia Commons for Belarusian stadiums so that outdated information does not mislead readers. If you want to make sure the veracity of my arguments, I can connect administrators from the Belarusian Wikipedia to the discussion. We will provide links to the official administrative-territorial structure of the Republic of BELARUS for the current time of 2019. Thanks for attention!",

To summarize: You are not seeing a problem with the encyclopedia articles here on the English Wikipedia. You do think there is a problem with the data on certain pages at Wikimedia Commons, for example: commons:Category:Dynama Stadium, Minsk. For pages such as that on Wikimedia Commons, that data is usually generated via a template there, commons:Template:Wikidata Infobox, which in turn gets values from another project, WikiData. There should be a blue pencil icon at the bottom of those Infoboxes on commons that you can use to go to WikiData then make appropriate edits. For example, wikidata:Q4439085 has location properties (e.g. located in the administrative territorial entity) that you can update. Assuming this is correct, there is nothing that the English Wikipedia editors would directly do about this, but you can edit them directly. Does that help?",

You correctly said that you first need to enter information about location of the stadium on WikiData. If the stadium was built in 2014, then on the Wikimedia Commons page of this stadium in the table in the upper right (Wikidata Infobox), the location is correct — Borisov, Borisov district, Minsk region, Belarus. And if the stadium was built in 1934, then information on the countries that existed on the territory of modern Belarus is indicated on the Wikimedia Commons. These countries and their parts were in the 1930s, but now they are no longer there. And on the page of the stadium on the Wikimedia Commons they are indicated, which misleads the reader. At the moment, all Belarusian stadiums are located on the territory of the Republic of Belarus and its administrative parts. If this issue cannot be resolved with the administrators of the English Wikipedia, should I write the same thing to the administrators of the Wikimedia Commons? Just administrators from Belarus are not there, so I decided to write here first.",

It's not that easy to make the wanted change. Dinamo Stadium (Minsk) (Q1130487) says inception 1934 (when the stadium was built in Minsk). Minsk (Q2280) specifies \"located in the administrative territorial entity\" for Minsk at different times, e.g. \"Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic\" from 1930 to 1938. commons:Template:Wikidata Infobox apparently combines the construction year and correct location data for that year to say that the stadium is in the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. For a currently used facility like a stadium, it would be best to ignore the construction year and give the current location, but this choice may be hard to figure out for a template. I don't know how a user can fix it for this page without deleting the information in Minsk (Q2280) about where Minsk was located in the past. Don't do that. Such information has many other uses.
