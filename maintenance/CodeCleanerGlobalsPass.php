/**
 * Prefix the real command with a 'global $VAR, $VAR2, ...;' command, where $VAR etc.
 * are the current global variables. This will make the shell behave as if it was running
 * in the global scope (almost; variables created in the shell won't become global if no
 * global variable by that name existed before) so debugging MediaWikis globals-based
 * configuration settings is less cumbersome, and behavior is closer to that of eval.php.
