== Upgrading notes for 1.37 ==
Don't forget to always back up your database before upgrading!

See the file UPGRADE for more detailed per-version upgrade instructions from the
oldest supported upgrading version, MediaWiki 1.27.

Some specific notes for MediaWiki 1.37 upgrades are below:
* (T280806) Deprecated methods of fetching API tokens have been removed. This
  may cause older bots and scripts to fail. Most queries are trivially
  updateable to using new methods. See the Action API changes section below
  for more information.

For notes on 1.36.x and older releases, see HISTORY.

=== Configuration changes for system administrators in 1.37 ===
* (T242768) The PasswordCannotMatchUsername password policy has been removed,
  please use PasswordCannotBeSubstringInUsername instead. If you have not
  customised your password policies, there will be nothing to do here.

==== New configuration ====
* $wgBrowserFormatDetection - This setting allows the enabling or disabling
  of automatic detection of possible phone numbers in a webpage in iOS Safari.
* $wgParserEnableLegacyMediaDOM - This setting defaults to true, and enables
  the legacy media HTML structure in the output from the Parser.  The
  alternative modern HTML structure for media is described at
  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Parsing/Media_structure
  In a future release of MediaWiki this option will default to false,
  so it's a good idea to test this setting on your wiki early and report
  any issues.

==== Changed configuration ====
* $wgContentHandlerTextFallback - This migration setting, which defines how to
  react if a plain text version of a non-text Content object is requested using
  ContentHandler::getContentText(), is deprecated.
* $wgActions – This setting lets sysadmins over-ride which actions can be used.
  It has been re-worked to support injecting dependencies into Action sub-
  classes as part of wider work on dependency injection. Previously, $wgActions
  was an array where the keys were the names of actions, and the values had the
  following impacts (for a given key 'Foo'):
  - `true`: use the class 'FooAction' unless for a specific page
    WikiPage::getActionOverrides() wants to override that action
  - a string: use the class with that name, and do not allow over-riding on a
    per-page basis
  - `false`: the action is disabled
  - a callable: use the Action instance returned by invoking that callback, and
    do not allow overriding on a per-page basis
  - an object: use that specific Action instance, and do not allow overr-iding
    on a per-page basis.
  As part of T253078, values can now be arrays that are not callables, which are
  treated as ObjectFactory specs, allowing for services to be injected.
  Additionally, the distinction between values that allow per-page overrides and
  those that do not was removed - all actions can now be overridden on a per-
  page basis using WikiPage::getActionOverrides().
* $wgShellboxUrl – This setting, new in 1.36 to configure the novel Shellbox
  encapsulation system, is now deprecated; use $wgShellboxUrls as a mapping of
  service => URL instead.
* $wgIncludejQueryMigrate – This setting, introduced in 1.29 to on whether to
  provide a migration layer for jQuery, has now switched its default value from
  true to false. This may break gadgets that depended on methods that were
  removed in jQuery 3 in 2017. See T280944 for more information.
* A number of settings have been renamed. The former configuration variable
  names are deprecated, but will be used as the fall back if they are still set,
  and remain temporarily available for extensions which might try to read them:
  - $wgFileBlacklist is now $wgProhibitedFileExtensions
  - $wgMimeTypeBlacklist is now $wgMimeTypeExclusions
  - $wgEnableUserEmailBlacklist is now $wgEnableUserEmailMuteList
  - $wgShortPagesNamespaceBlacklist is now $wgShortPagesNamespaceExclusions
* $wgMimeTypeExclusions - As well as being renamed, this configuration array now
  also prohibits the RFC 4329 form of JavaScript, 'application/javascript', as
  well as previous MIME types.
* $wgFragmentMode - This setting, which determines the encoding of section IDs,
  has now switched its default value from legacy-first to html5-first: both the
  HTML5 anchor and the legacy percent-encoding-style anchor will still be
  generated for section titles, but references to them will use the HTML5
  version, resulting in human-readable fragments.

==== Removed configuration ====
* $wgLegacyJavaScriptGlobals, deprecated in 1.36.
* (T274695) $wgAjaxEditStash, deprecated in 1.36.
* $wgShowDBErrorBacktrace, deprecated and non-functional since 1.32.
* $wgShowSQLErrors, deprecated and non-functional since 1.32.
* $wgLangObjCacheSize, without deprecation; the LanguageFactory service now
  always retains at most 10 objects in its LRU-cache.
* $wgDjvuToXML, without deprecation; the tool it enables is obsolete and
  abandoned upstream. Use $wgDjvuDump to use that tool instead.

=== New user-facing features in 1.37 ===

  were removed:
    - ArticleRevisionUndeleted - use RevisionUndeleted
    - ArticleRollbackComplete - use RollbackComplete
    - DiffRevisionTools - use DiffTools

    - EditPage::$mBaseRevision
    - EditPage::getBaseRevision()
    - LinksUpdate::getRevision()
    - LinksUpdate::setRevision()
    - PageArchive::getArchivedRevision()

  The following methods return arrays that formerly included a 'revision'
  key that would emit deprecation warnings when accessed and return a
  Revision object. The Revision object has been removed from the arrays,
  and the 'revision-record' key should be used to get the relevant
  RevisionRecord instead:
    - PageUpdater::doCreate()
    - PageUpdater::doModify()
    - Parser::statelessFetchTemplate()
    - WikiPage::doEditContent()
  Finally, the ParserOptions `templateCallback` option is a callback that is
  called in Parser::fetchTemplateAndTitle() and should return an array - the
  'revision' key to that array used to be a Revision object and was used if
  no 'revision-record' was returned - is now ignored.
* Previously, the classes RevisionTestModifyableContent and
  RevisionTestModifyableContentHandler were loaded for use in tests, but were
  only used within the tests for the since-removed Revision class. This content
  and content handler class were removed without deprecation.

  since 1.36, has been removed. Use "mediawiki.action.protect" instead.
* The JavaScript alias $j for references to jQuery, deprecated since 1.23, has
  been removed. Use $ instead.

  extend the PSR LoggerAwareInterface concept, so they can't be typehinted as
  LoggerAwareInterface.

  removed. Use MWGrants::grantName() instead.
* The following ApiBase methods, deprecated since 1.35, have been removed:
  - ApiBase::explodeMultiValue
  - ApiBase::parseMultiValue
  - ApiBase::validateLimit
  - ApiBase::validateTimestamp

  Instead of using it, get a UserIdentity by name from the UserIdentityLookup
  service.
* IDatabase::upsert() and IDatabase::replace() now only accept a single unique
  key. Previously, a warning was issued if there were multiple unique keys
  provided.
* The MediaWiki:Autoblock_whitelist block exemption control was moved in 1.36 to
  MediaWiki:Block-autoblock-exemptionlist. The backward-compatibility of reading
  the old MediaWiki:Autoblock_whitelist page has now been dropped.

  - File::deleteFile() - now accepts UserIdentity instead of User
  - File::getDescription() - now accepts Authority instead of User

* The following CLI options were removed from tests/phpunit.php:
    - use-filebackend
    - use-jobqueue
    - use-bagostuff
  The following options (inherited from Maintenance) were also removed:
    - conf
    - dbuser
    - dbpass
    - dbdefaultgroup
    - globals
    - memory-limit
    - profiler
    - server
  The following options were changed to environment variables:
    - wiki => PHPUNIT_WIKI
    - use-normal-tables => PHPUNIT_USE_NORMAL_TABLES
    - use-filebackend => PHPUNIT_USE_FILEBACKEND
    - use-bagostuff => PHPUNIT_USE_BAGOSTUFF
    - use-jobqueue => PHPUNIT_USE_JOBQUEUE
  This is so that we can use the default PHPUnit entry point (T90875).
* The PHPUNIT_REUSE_DB / --reuse-db option was removed from the phpunit.php
  runner. It had been broken for at least three years already. The original use
  case was speeding up tests on Oracle, but Oracle support was dropped several
  releases ago.
* The MediaWikiPHPUnitTest__endTestHook and MediaWikiPHPUnitTest__startTestHook
  PHPUnit hooks were removed. MediaWikiHooksPHPUnitExtension was also removed.
* EntryPoint::getTextFormatters() was made private without a deprecation period;
  it had no known external callers.
* DatabaseBlock::chooseBlock(), deprecated since 1.35, was removed.
* SpecialPageFactory::getRestrictedPages(), deprecated since 1.36, was removed.
* SpecialBlock::validateTarget(), deprecated since 1.36, was removed.
* The PatchFileLocation trait was removed without deprecation.
* ActorMigrationBase::getExistingActorId() and ::getNewActorId(), emitting
  deprecation warnings since 1.36, were removed.
* Hook handlers implementing the MediaWikiServicesHook hook are now prohibited
  from having services injected. This is because by definition, this hook runs
  before the service container is fully initialized.
* The protected property LocalFile::$metadata was removed without deprecation.
* WatchedItem::getUser(), emitting deprecation warnings since 1.36, has been
  removed.
* AuthManager::singleton(), emitting deprecation warnings since 1.36, has been
  removed.
* The AugmentPageProps class was removed without deprecation. It had no known
  uses.
* Html::infobox(), deprecated since 1.36, was removed.
* ParserOptions::__construct() now requires that the first parameter is a
  UserIdentity object - passing `null` used to fallback to the global
  $wgUser but was deprecated since 1.36.
* ParserOptions::newCanonical() no longer supports the first parameter being
  null (or omitted entirely), which would fallback to the global $wgUser but
  was deprecated since 1.35.
* The SkinTemplatePreventOtherActiveTabs hook, deprecated in 1.35, was removed
  entirely.
* The SkinTemplateTabAction hook, deprecated in 1.35, was removed entirely.
* The SkinTemplateBuildNavUrlsNav_urlsAfterPermalink hook, deprecated in 1.35,
  was removed entirely.
* The SkinTemplateToolboxEndHook, deprecated in 1.35, was removed entirely.
* The following methods of RevisionStore class, formerly emitting deprecation
  warnings, were removed:
  - ::newMutableRevisionFromArray()
  - ::loadRevisionFromPageId()
  - ::loadRevisionFromTitle()
  - ::loadRevisionFromTimestamp()
  - ::listRevisionSizes()
* LogEntry::getPerformer(), deprecated since 1.36, was removed along with
  methods in sub-classes: DatabaseLogEntry, ManualLogEntry, RCDatabaseLogEntry.
* Skin::getRelevantUser() now returns an instance of UserIdentity, and not
  necessarily a User object. There is no known usages in MediaWiki ecosystem
  that were not satisfied with UserIdentity.
* Direct construction of MergeHistory class, deprecated since 1.35, is no longer
  supported. Use MergeHistoryFactory instead. MergeHistory::checkPermissions,
  deprecated since 1.36, was removed.
* Skin::generateDebugHTML(), deprecated since 1.35, was removed. Call
  MWDebug::getHTMLDebugLog() directly.
* The ApiTestCase class no longer interacts with the global $wgUser.
  Previously, the global variable was set at the start of each test, and in
  ApiTestCase::doApiRequest() if a performer was specified $wgUser was
  updated to match, and if no performer was specified $wgUser was used
  instead. Now, $wgUser is not updated, and if no performer is specified
  the reusable TestUser object for the sysop is relied on. Extensions
  or skins that rely on the global $wgUser variable (which has been
  deprecated since 1.35) should instead retrieve the acting user from the
  relevant context source.
* SkinTemplate::makeArticleUrlDetails(), deprecated since 1.35, was removed.
* Skin::makeNSUrl(), deprecated since 1.35, was removed.
* Skin::getRevisionId(), deprecated since 1.34, was removed. Use
  OutputPage::getRevisionId() instead.
* Skin::isRevisionCurrent(), deprecated since 1.34, was removed. Use
  OutputPage::isRevisionCurrent() instead.

  deprecation warnings:
    - the 'byText' property with blocker's name,
    - the 'by' property with blocker's ID,
  For both of these, use the 'by' property with UserIdentity value instead.
* The BeforeResetNotificationTimestamp hook was deprecated.

* User::getEditTokenObject(), ::getEditToken(), and ::matchEditToken() were each
  deprecated. Use CsrfTokenRepository, which is available via IContextSource,
  instead. ::matchEditTokenNoSuffix() was deprecated without replacement.
  It was introduced to be able to provide custom error message if the token
  was submitted, but ending slashes were stripped by some ASCII mangling proxy.

  warnings.
* User::listOptionKinds(), deprecated since 1.35, now emits deprecation

* Relying on PermissionManager or Authority to check for big deletions
  was deprecated. This is now automatically checked if you use
  DeletePage::deleteIfAllowed(). (T288759)

  getUserPermissionsErrors or getUserPermissionsErrorsExpensive hooks instead.
* Parser::$mUser public access, and the methods ParserOptions::getUser() and
  Parser::getUser() each now emit deprecation warnings.

   - PPDPart has been merged into PPDPart_Hash
   - PPDStack has been merged into PPDStack_Hash
   - PPDStackElement has been merged into PPDStackElement_Hash
* By default, the global variable $wgUser is now an instance of the new class
  StubGlobalUser rather than User, and the first time it is used it will emit
  deprecation warnings (the $wgUser variable was deprecated in 1.35). For
  extensions that read from this variable, please use a relevant ContextSource
  instead, falling back to RequestContext::getMain() if none is available.
* Collation::singleton() and ::factory() were deprecated; obtain an instance of
  the CollationFactory from MediaWikiServices instead.
* Title::getDefaultNamespace() has been deprecated to be removed because there
  are no known callers/consumers.

=== Other changes in 1.37 ===
* WatchlistManager::addWatch() and WatchlistManager::addWatchIgnoringRights(),
  which replace User::addWatch(), now call the WatchArticle and
  WatchArticleComplete hooks.
* WatchlistManager::removeWatch() and
  WatchlistManager::removeWatchIgnoringRights(), which replace
  User::removeWatch(), now call the UnwatchArticle and UnwatchArticleComplete
  hooks.
* The overridable postInitSetup() method was added to the
  AbstractAuthenticationProvider class. A provider can override postInitSetup()
  to do any custom post-initialization configuration.
* The overridable postInitSetup() method was added to the SessionProvider
  class. A provider can override postInitSetup() to do any custom
  post-initialization configuration.
* The protected getConfig() method was added to the SessionProvider class.
  Use SessionProvider::getConfig() to get a config.
* The DBAccessBase class is deprecated. Classes that used to extend it
  should get a load balancer (factory) injected in the constructor instead.
* ActorNormalization::acquireActorId() now requires IDatabase parameter.
  Not providing one emitted deprecation warnings since 1.36.
* Anti-lock constants ALF_PRELOAD_LINK, ALF_NO_BLOCK_LOCK, ALF_NO_LINK_LOCK
  and ALF_PRELOAD_EXISTENCE have been removed. They're unused since 1.25.
* (T278036) CSS class 'mw-htmlform-field-autoinfuse' used by some forms has been

  are only designed for use by skins extended BaseTemplate. You can move calls
  to instead use BaseTemplate::getPoweredByHTML() and ::getCopyrightIconHTML()
  respectively.
* The SkinGetPoweredBy hook is deprecated. No replacement is provided.
* HTMLTitleTextField didn't support interwiki titles well previously.
  Starting with 1.37, HTMLTitleTextField has a new parameter, 'interwiki',
  which can be used to control acceptance of interwiki titles. To provide
  a transitional period, the default value ('interwiki' => null) ensures
  MW will have the same behavior as before (logging a deprecation warning).
  In 1.38, the default behavior will change to "interwiki links aren't allowed".
