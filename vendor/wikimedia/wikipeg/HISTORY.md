# Release History

## 2.0.6 (2021-08-07)
* Changed package namespace from WikiPEG to Wikimedia\WikiPEG to match
  composer package name. PHP's `class_alias` has been used so that existing
  code using the old namespace will continue to work, but this is now
  deprecated; it is expected that the next major release of WikiPEG will
  remove the aliases.
* Dependency updates.
* Added a place in the template to add header comments.
* Add phpcs and reformat PHP code to MediaWiki codestyle.
* Add phan and fix minor issues.

## 2.0.5 (2020-12-17)
* Add PHP 8.0 support plus better CI tests for the PHP code.

## 2.0.4 (2020-02-13)
* Add  .gitattributes file to reduce downloaded cruft when imported as a
  library.
* Fix an obscure bug when the grammar contains cycles.
* Fix DefaultTracer: the location is a LocationRange object now.

## 2.0.3 (2019-04-25)
* Move spec to tests/jasmine.
* Fix to error construction.
* Fix expectation sorting.
* Another fix for the ast.initializer format change.
* SyntaxError: correctly call parent constructor.
* Fix encoding of astral plane characters in string literals (PHP backend)
* Fix missing bracket in matchLiteral() (PHP backend)
* Add cross-language testing and fix JS generator bugs identified by it.
* Classes for Location, LocationRange, and Expectation (PHP backend)
* Fix TestRunner error() call
* Simplify loops zero_or_more and one_or_more
* Fix caching of reference rule variables.
* Better default keys for PHP and JS.

## 2.0.2 (2019-04-25)
There is no 2.0.2.

## 2.0.1 (2019-03-28)
Fix visitor for new multiple initializer feature

ast.initializer is now the same as before if there are 0 or 1
initializers, and an array if there are 2 or more. Update visitor for
this. During development I initially made it be an array
unconditionally, but I changed it to this more compatible format shortly
before merging in order to make the tests pass, but neglected to update
visitor.

## 2.0.0 (2019-03-11)
PHP backend

Add a PHP code generation mode.

Mapping overview:

* File extension .pegphp hints to the binary that PHP is to be generated
* Generated PHP code depends on a PSR-4 runtime library directory. I
  used "src" for this, and moved the one file that was there out to
  lib/.
* JavaScript's enclosing scope is generally replaced by private and
  protected members of the generated class or its parent. For example,
  input becomes $this->input.
* PHP's offsets are byte offsets, not UTF-16 offsets as in JS. Rules
  such as . (any) return a full UTF-8 character, by means of our own
  simple UTF-8 decoder.
* The AST initializer is placed inside the definition of the generated
  class, so private function declarations are appropriate, and
  $this->input etc. is accessible.
* Actions and semantic predicates become private methods.

Changes:

* Add ported examples for arithmetic and CSS
* Remove the ability to run the generator in the browser. It is probably
  still possible to use generated parsers in the browser.
* Merge common-helpers, trace-helpers and wrapper.js into a single
  template file. The helper files were mostly there to support the
  browser mode.
* Give actions a separate namespace from consts, since it's not
  convenient in PHP to treat a function as a variable.
* To run the start rule, instead of a hashtable of closures, use a
  switch statement. This is simpler and works in both languages. The
  hashtable of closures made more sense when it was possible to run
  start rules directly, but now we have to supply default parameters for
  them, so there was already an extra proxy closure.
* Use template literals throughout, since they look very nice in this
  use case and are presumably efficient.
* For streaming mode, use a generator instead of an iterator, since PHP
  has generators using similar syntax to ES6, whereas PHP's iterator
  syntax is quite different.
* Make the version 2.0.0.

## 1.0.2 (2019-03-11)
* Fix file list in package.json and increment version.

## 1.0.0 (2019-02-08)
* Call this WikiPEG 1.0.0.
* Rename the binary and NPM project.
* Remove documentation of the browser target since this is
  now unmaintained.
* Require Node.js 6+, like Parsoid. The upcoming feature commit will use
  some ES6 features.
* Retain the file extension .pegjs for now.

## 0.8.0 (December 24, 2013)

### Big Changes

  * Completely rewrote the code generator. Among other things, it allows
    optimizing generated parsers for parsing speed or code size using the
    `optimize` option of the `PEG.buildParser` method or the `--optimize`/`-o`
    option on the command-line. All internal identifiers in generated code now
    also have a `peg$` prefix to discourage their use and avoid conflicts.
    [[#35](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/35),
    [#92](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/92)]

  * Completely redesigned error handling. Instead of returning `null` inside
    actions to indicate match failure, new `expected` and `error` functions can
    be called to trigger an error. Also, expectation inside the `SyntaxError`
    exceptions are now structured to allow easier machine processing.
    [[#198](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/198)]

  * Implemented a plugin API. The list of plugins to use can be specified using
    the `plugins` option of the `PEG.buildParser` method or the `--plugin`
    option on the command-line. Also implemented the `--extra-options` and
    `--extra-options-file` command-line options, which are mainly useful to pass
    additional options to plugins.
    [[#106](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/106)]

  * Made `offset`, `line` and `column` functions, not variables. They are now
    available in all parsers and return lazily-computed position data. Removed
    now useless `trackLineAndColumn` option of the `PEG.buildParser` method and
    the `--track-line-and-column` option on the command-line.

  * Added a new `text` function. When called inside an action, it returns the
    text matched by action's expression.
    [[#131](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/131)]

  * Added a new `$` operator. It extracts matched strings from expressions.

  * The `?` operator now returns `null` on unsuccessful match.

  * Predicates now always return `undefined`.

  * Replaced the `startRule` parameter of the `parse` method in generated
    parsers with more generic `options` parameter. The start rule can now be
    specified as the `startRule` option. The `options` parameter can be also
    used to pass custom options to the parser because it is visible as the
    `options` variable inside parser code.
    [[#37](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/37)]

  * The list of allowed start rules of a generated parser now has to be
    specified explicitly using the `allowedStartRules` option of the
    `PEG.buildParser` method or the `--allowed-start-rule` option on the
    command-line. This will make certain optimizations like rule inlining easier
    in the future.

  * Removed the `toSource` method of generated parsers and introduced a new
    `output` option of the `PEG.buildParser` method. It allows callers to
    specify whether they want to get back the parser object or its source code.

  * The source code is now a valid npm package. This makes using development
    versions easier.
    [[#32](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/32)]

  * Generated parsers are now ~25% faster and ~62%/~3% smaller (when optimized
    for size/speed) than those generated by 0.7.0.

  * Requires Node.js 0.8.0+.

### Small Changes

  * `bin/pegjs` now outputs just the parser source if the value of the
    `--export-var` option is empty. This makes embedding generated parsers into
    other files easier.
    [[#143](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/143)]

  * Changed the value of the `name` property of `PEG.GrammarError` instances
    from “PEG.GrammarError” to just “GrammarError”. This better reflects the
    fact that PEG.js can get required with different variable name than `PEG`.

  * Setup prototype chain for `PEG.GrammarError` correctly.

  * Setup prototype chain for `SyntaxError` in generated parsers correctly.

  * Fixed error messages in certain cases with trailing input
    [[#119](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/119)]

  * Fixed code generated for classes starting with `\^`.
    [[#125](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/125)]

  * Fixed too eager proxy rules removal.
    [[#137](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/137)]

  * Added a license to all vendored libraries.
    [[#207](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/207)]

  * Converted the test suite from QUnit to Jasmine, cleaning it up on the way.

  * Travis CI integration.

  * Various internal code improvements and fixes.

  * Various generated code improvements and fixes.

  * Various example grammar improvements and fixes.

  * Improved `README.md`.

  * Converted `CHANGELOG` to Markdown.

## 0.7.0 (April 18, 2012)

### Big Changes

  * Added ability to pass options to `PEG.buildParser`.

  * Implemented the `trackLineAndColumn` option for `PEG.buildParser` (together
    with the `--track-line-and-column` command-line option). It makes the
    generated parser track line and column during parsing. These are made
    available inside actions and predicates as `line` and `column` variables.

  * Implemented the `cache` option for `PEG.buildParser` (together with the
    `--cache` command-line option). This option enables/disables the results
    cache in generated parsers, resulting in dramatic speedup when the cache is
    disabled (the default now). The cost is breaking the linear parsing time
    guarantee.

  * The current parse position is visible inside actions and predicates as the
    `offset` variable.

  * Exceptions thrown by the parser have `offset`, `expected` and `found`
    properties containing machine-readable information about the parse failure
    (based on a patch by Marcin Stefaniuk).

  * Semantic predicates have access to preceding labels.
    [[GH-69](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/69)]

  * Implemented case-insensitive literal and class matching.
    [[GH-34](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/34)]

  * Rewrote the code generator — split some computations into separate passes
    and based it on a proper templating system (Codie).

  * Rewrote variable handling in generated parsers in a stack-like fashion,
    simplifying the code and making the parsers smaller and faster.

  * Adapted to Node.js 0.6.6+ (no longer supported in older versions).

  * Dropped support for IE < 8.

  * As a result of several optimizations, parsers generated by 0.7.0 are ~6.4
    times faster and ~19% smaller than those generated by 0.6.2 (as reported by
    `/tools/impact`).

### Small Changes

  * Fixed reported error position when part of the input is not consumed.
    [[GH-48](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/48)]

  * Fixed incorrect disjunction operator in `computeErrorPosition` (original
    patch by Wolfgang Kluge).

  * Fixed regexp for detecting command-line options in `/bin/pegjs`.
    [[GH-51](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/51)]

  * Generate more efficient code for empty literals (original patch by Wolfgang
    Kluge).

  * Fixed comment typos (patches by Wolfgang Kluge and Jason Davies).
    [[GH-59](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/59)]

  * Fixed a typo in JavaScript example grammar.
    [[GH-62](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/62)]

  * Made copy & paste inclusion of the PEG.js library into another code easier
    by changing how the library is exported.

  * Improved the copyright comment and the “Generated by...” header.

  * Replaced `Jakefile` with `Makefile`.

  * Added `make hint` task that checks all JavaScript files using JSHint and
    resolved all issues it reported. All JavaScript files and also generated
    parsers are JSHint-clean now.

  * Fixed output printed during test failures (expected value was being printed
    instead of the actual one). Original patch by Wolfgang Kluge.

  * Added a `/tools/impact` script to measure speed and size impact of commits.

  * Various generated code improvements and fixes.

  * Various internal code improvements and fixes.

  * Improved `README.md`.

## 0.6.2 (August 20, 2011)

### Small Changes

  * Reset parser position when action returns `null`.

  * Fixed typo in JavaScript example grammar.

## 0.6.1 (April 14, 2011)

### Small Changes

  * Use `--ascii` option when generating a minified version.

## 0.6.0 (April 14, 2011)

### Big Changes

  * Rewrote the command-line mode to be based on Node.js instead of Rhino — no
    more Java dependency. This also means that PEG.js is available as a Node.js
    package and can be required as a module.

  * Version for the browser is built separately from the command-line one in two
    flavors (normal and minified).

  * Parser variable name is no longer required argument of `bin/pegjs` — it is
    `module.exports` by default and can be set using the `-e`/`--export-var`
    option. This makes parsers generated by `/bin/pegjs` Node.js modules by
    default.

  * Added ability to start parsing from any grammar rule.

  * Added several compiler optimizations — 0.6 is ~12% faster than 0.5.1 in the
    benchmark on V8.

### Small Changes

  * Split the source code into multiple files combined together using a build
    system.

  * Jake is now used instead of Rake for build scripts — no more Ruby
    dependency.

  * Test suite can be run from the command-line.

  * Benchmark suite can be run from the command-line.

  * Benchmark browser runner improvements (users can specify number of runs,
    benchmarks are run using `setTimeout`, table is centered and fixed-width).

  * Added PEG.js version to “Generated by...” line in generated parsers.

  * Added PEG.js version information and homepage header to `peg.js`.

  * Generated code improvements and fixes.

  * Internal code improvements and fixes.

  * Rewrote `README.md`.

## 0.5.1 (November 28, 2010)

### Small Changes

  * Fixed a problem where “SyntaxError: Invalid range in character class.” error
    appeared when using command-line version on Widnows
    ([GH-13](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/13)).

  * Fixed wrong version reported by `bin/pegjs --version`.

  * Removed two unused variables in the code.

  * Fixed incorrect variable name on two places.

## 0.5 (June 10, 2010)

### Big Changes

  * Syntax change: Use labeled expressions and variables instead of `$1`, `$2`,
    etc.

  * Syntax change: Replaced `:` after a rule name with `=`.

  * Syntax change: Allow trailing semicolon (`;`) for rules

  * Semantic change: Start rule of the grammar is now implicitly its first rule.

  * Implemented semantic predicates.

  * Implemented initializers.

  * Removed ability to change the start rule when generating the parser.

  * Added several compiler optimizations — 0.5 is ~11% faster than 0.4 in the
    benchmark on V8.

### Small Changes

  * `PEG.buildParser` now accepts grammars only in string format.

  * Added “Generated by ...” message to the generated parsers.

  * Formatted all grammars more consistently and transparently.

  * Added notes about ECMA-262, 5th ed. compatibility to the JSON example
    grammar.

  * Guarded against redefinition of `undefined`.

  * Made `bin/pegjs` work when called via a symlink
    ([issue #1](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/1)).

  * Fixed bug causing incorrect error messages
    ([issue #2](https://github.com/dmajda/pegjs/issues/2)).

  * Fixed error message for invalid character range.

  * Fixed string literal parsing in the JavaScript grammar.

  * Generated code improvements and fixes.

  * Internal code improvements and fixes.

  * Improved `README.md`.

## 0.4 (April 17, 2010)

### Big Changes

  * Improved IE compatibility — IE6+ is now fully supported.

  * Generated parsers are now standalone (no runtime is required).

  * Added example grammars for JavaScript, CSS and JSON.

  * Added a benchmark suite.

  * Implemented negative character classes (e.g. `[^a-z]`).

  * Project moved from BitBucket to GitHub.

### Small Changes

  * Code generated for the character classes is now regexp-based (= simpler and
    more scalable).

  * Added `\uFEFF` (BOM) to the definition of whitespace in the metagrammar.

  * When building a parser, left-recursive rules (both direct and indirect) are
    reported as errors.

  * When building a parser, missing rules are reported as errors.

  * Expected items in the error messages do not contain duplicates and they are
    sorted.

  * Fixed several bugs in the example arithmetics grammar.

  * Converted `README` to GitHub Flavored Markdown and improved it.

  * Added `CHANGELOG`.

  * Internal code improvements.

## 0.3 (March 14, 2010)

  * Wrote `README`.

  * Bootstrapped the grammar parser.

  * Metagrammar recognizes JavaScript-like comments.

  * Changed standard grammar extension from `.peg` to `.pegjs` (it is more
    specific).

  * Simplified the example arithmetics grammar + added comment.

  * Fixed a bug with reporting of invalid ranges such as `[b-a]` in the
    metagrammar.

  * Fixed `--start` vs. `--start-rule` inconsistency between help and actual
    option processing code.

  * Avoided ugliness in QUnit output.

  * Fixed typo in help: `parserVar` → `parser_var`.

  * Internal code improvements.

## 0.2.1 (March 8, 2010)

  * Added `pegjs-` prefix to the name of the minified runtime file.

## 0.2 (March 8, 2010)

  * Added `Rakefile` that builds minified runtime using Google Closure Compiler
    API.

  * Removed trailing commas in object initializers (Google Closure does not like
    them).

## 0.1 (March 8, 2010)

  * Initial release.
